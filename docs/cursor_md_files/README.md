# Cursor AI Session Documentation

This directory contains documentation files generated during AI-assisted development sessions.

## Purpose

These files capture:
- **Implementation guides** - Step-by-step guides for features implemented
- **Hotfixes** - Documentation of production issues and their resolutions
- **Deployment guides** - Platform-specific deployment instructions
- **Technical decisions** - Rationale behind architectural choices
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and their solutions

## Organization

Files are named to indicate their purpose:
- `HOTFIX_*.md` - Production hotfixes and emergency fixes
- `*_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guides for various platforms
- `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Feature implementation documentation
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant context and guidelines

## Usage

These files serve as:
1. **Historical record** of how features were built
2. **Onboarding material** for new developers
3. **Reference documentation** for deployment and operations
4. **Context** for future AI-assisted development sessions

## Maintenance

- Keep files up-to-date when implementations change
- Archive obsolete documentation to `docs/archived/` if needed
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include dates in content when relevant
